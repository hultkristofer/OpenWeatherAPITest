Using PyOWM to pull from API.

PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.

It allows quick and easy consumption of OWM weather data from Python applications via a simple object model and in a human-friendly fashion.

install using

$ pip install pyowm


Using this module so I do not have to worry about maintaing the API connection.

Ran into issues with Visual Studio not recognizing the Module was installed and only opening in Visual Studio.

Ways to improve:

Add in tests for valid city, no numbers, only str/english characters are entered


Same as what is in the .py file


Running:

1. Run by launching file openWeatherAPI Test.py
2. Enter city name when prompted
3. Should show weather in printed statement.
